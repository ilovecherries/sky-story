Sky Story (PROTOTYPE 0001)
Written by Cherry (cherry@epochal.quest)

This is a rewrite of a small prototype I wrote for a game that I had
planned on making a while back. The only reason that this is a rewrite
is that the original game was written in SmileBASIC.

I'm currently using Raylib to write it but I think I'm probably going to switch
to SDL2 because Raylib seems like it will be annoying to port to other things.

The most recent save to this game was supposedly 2017/10/01
